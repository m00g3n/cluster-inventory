# Infrastructure manager

## Overview

This project responsible for managing [Kyma](https://kyma-project.io/#/) clusters infrastructure. Built using [kubebuilder framework](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder)

It's current responsibilities are:
- Generating and rotating secrets containing dynamic kubeconfigs

## Prerequisites

- Access to a k8s cluster.You can use [k3d](https://k3d.io) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)

## Installation

1. Clone the project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kyma-project/infrastructure-manager.git && cd infrastructure-manager/
```

2. Set the `infrastructure-manager` image name.

```bash
export IMG=custom-infrastructure-manager:0.0.1
export K3D_CLUSTER_NAME=infrastructure-manager-demo
```

3. Build the project.

```bash
make build
```

4. Build the image.

```bash
make docker-build
```

5. Push the image to the registry.

<div tabs name="Push image" group="infrastructure-manager-installation">
  <details>
  <summary label="k3d">
  k3d
  </summary>


   ```bash
   k3d cluster create $K3D_CLUSTER_NAME
   k3d image import $IMG -c $K3D_CLUSTER_NAME
   ```
  </details>
  <details>
  <summary label="Docker registry">
  Globally available Docker registry
  </summary>

   ```bash
   make docker-push
   ```

  </details>
</div>

6. Deploy.

```bash
make deploy
```
7. Create a Secret with the Gardener credentials

```bash
export GARDENER_KUBECONFIG_PATH=<kubeconfig file for Gardener project> 
make gardener-secret-deploy
```

## Usage
Infrastructure Manager is responsible for creation and rotation of secrets of clusters defined in `GardenerCluster` CRs. Sample CR is available [here](config/samples/infrastructuremanager_v1_gardenercluster.yaml).   

### Time based rotation
Secrets are totated based on the `kubeconfig-expiration-time`, see [the configuration section](docs/README.md#configuration).

### Force rotation
It's possible to force secret rotation before the time based rotation kicks in. In order to do that, add the `operator.kyma-project.io/force-kubeconfig-rotation: "true"` annotation to the `GardenCluster` Custom Resource.

> Explain how to use the project. You can create multiple subsections (H3). Include the instructions or provide links to the related documentation.
